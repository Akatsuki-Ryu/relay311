# About the San Jose Open 311 Build with Ionic Project

Thanks for stopping by. This readme file includes information pertaining to the San Jose Open 311 build with Ionic, which is a sub-project under the Open 311 project. Our aim is to develop a “311 Gateway”, which will provide a uniform, RESTful, standard API interface. This API interface will allow mobile developers to code against a single API, yet their app will work across a wider geographic area. For further details about the Open 311 project, see https://github.com/codeforsanjose/open311_gateway.
