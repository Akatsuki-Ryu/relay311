# About the San Jose Open 311 Build with Ionic

This is the mobile app repo which is a sub-project under the Open 311 project. This project will create a 311 App for both Android and iOS.  The App will be built using the Open 311 standard.  Thus users of this codebase can link to standard 311 servers or our 311 Open Gateway.
